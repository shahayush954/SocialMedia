# SocialMedia
A twitter based Clone built with ReactJs, NodeJs, ExpressJs and Google Firebase.

The project was built as a practice after have learnt the bascics of ReactJs and NodeJs. I have tried to add as many features like twitter as I could, although this is the first
version and am looking forward to keep improving and adding new features to it. For more details continue reading further.

## Directory Structure.

  1.  The folder social-media-functions folder contains all the backend code, functions and all the routes for various API calls. All the API routes were built using NodeJs, ExpresJs and 
      Google Firebase as a NoSQL database.
  2.  The social-media-client folder contains all the frontend part of the project. Entire frontend is built using ReactJs and have also used Material-UI as frontend UI library.
  3.  The project also uses Redux for effective state management.
  4.  Within the social-media-client folder, resides the src folder which is used for developing the project. The build folder within contains the development build of the project
      ready for deployment.
